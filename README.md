ðŸ”¹ Step-by-Step Process

Setup Project

Created a folder structure with index.html, about.html, contact.html, css/style.css, and img/profile.jpg.

Added Bootstrap 5 via CDN.

Explored Bootstrap 5

Reviewed the official documentation and Bootstrap Examples.

Picked reusable components: Navbar, Hero, Cards, Forms, and Footer.

Page Development

Home Page â†’ Added Navbar, Hero with profile photo, Projects section (text-only cards), and Footer.

About Page â†’ Added About Me description, Skills (badges), and Education details.

Contact Page â†’ Created a working contact form with Name, Email, and Message fields.

Styling & Responsiveness

Used Bootstrap grid and utility classes for spacing and alignment.

Added minor tweaks in style.css (smooth scroll, hero section height).

Tested on desktop and mobile views.

Hosting

Pushed the project to GitHub.

Deployed using GitHub Pages for live preview.

ðŸ”¹ Use of Tools & References

Bootstrap Docs â†’ For structure and components.

ChatGPT â†’ For guidance on layout, project structuring, and fixing issues.

GitHub Pages â†’ For deployment and hosting.

Did not directly copy full example pages â€” instead, remixed components creatively.

ðŸ”¹ Challenges Faced & Solutions

Profile image not showing up â†’ Solved by renaming file exactly as profile.jpg and placing it in img/ folder.

Unnecessary project images â†’ Removed them, kept only text-based project cards for a clean layout.

Ensuring consistency across pages â†’ Reused the same Navbar and Footer in all pages for uniform design.
